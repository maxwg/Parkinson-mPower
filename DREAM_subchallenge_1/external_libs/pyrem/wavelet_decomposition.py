    A wrapper around :func:`~pywt.wavedec`. It performs discrete wavelet decomposition and return the coefficients as a :class:`pyrem.polygram.Polygram`.
    It allows to select the wavelet coefficients to keep and can perform preliminary resampling of the signal.
    In the resulting polygram, the names of the coefficients will be suffixed by an an identifier describing their respective levels (i.e. cD_1, cD_2, ..., cD_N, cA_N).
    The sampling frequency of coefficients will also be automatically computed.
